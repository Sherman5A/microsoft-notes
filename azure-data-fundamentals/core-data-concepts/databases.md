# Databases

## Relational Database

Each instance has a primary key that uniqueely identifies the instance of the entity.
The keys are used to link the instance to another instance in a seperate entity.

This allows for the normailisation of data, which removes duplicate data and improves efficiency.

The tables are managed and queried with SQL.

## Non-relational / NoSQL Database

4 types:
1. Key-value database
