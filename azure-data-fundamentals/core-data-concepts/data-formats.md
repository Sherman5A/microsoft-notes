Data structures deal with how data is organised and represented.

An entitiy is an important class of data. This is stuff that could be made into a table. For example:
customers, products, sale orders, etc.

## Structured Data

Data that adheres to a fixed schema. All data must have the same fields and properties.

Schema's are typically tabular in nature.

Data is prestend in:
- Rows
    - Represent instances of the entity
    - They are sometimes referred to as records
- Columns,
    - Represent attributes of the entity
    - Sometimes referred to as fields

Structured data is typically used in databases, in relational form.

JSON is an example of semi-structured data.
