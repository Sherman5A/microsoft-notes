# Azure ExpressRoute

Azure connects to on-premises with its own private connection. However, it requires a connectivity
provider.

Provides:
- Higher security
- Increased reliability
- Faster speeds
- Better latencies

ExpressRoute can be connected globally using Microsoft's network. Facilities in Asia and Europe
can communicate privately.

Moreover, it provides redundancy and high availability.
