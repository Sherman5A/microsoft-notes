# Azure Functions

> Functions are an event-driven, server-less option.

Azure functions still use servers, but do not require the maintenance of VMs and containers by the
consumer.

VMs and containers must be constantly running.

However, functions event-driven nature mean they only activate and use resources when required.

Functions can be stateful or stateless.

Stateless functions behave as if they have been restarted on every request.

Stateful functions have context.

## Advantages of Azure Functions

- No infrastructure management
- Scalability
- Only pay for what you use
