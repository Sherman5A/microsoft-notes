Active Directory:
>A directory service is a database for storing and maintaining information about users and resources.

Azure offers Azure Active Directory that enables identity management cloud applications and on-premises
Active Directories.

## What is Active Directory

>Active Directory provides identity and access management for services. Azure adds cloud Active Directory.

Active Directory is used by:
- IT administrators
    - Use AD to control access to applications and resources based on the business' requirements
- App developers
    - Use AD to provide functionality to applications that they build. This could be Single Sign On,
      or letting apps work with existing AD credentials
- Users
    - Users can manage their identities and perform maintenance actions
- Online Service Subscribers
    - Microsoft 365 already uses Azure AD to authenticate logins

Active Directory provides:
- Authentication
    - Verifying identities to access resources
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Banned passwords
    - Smart lockouts
    - Password resets
- Single Sign On
    - SSO allows people to only sign into one account to access several applications
    - As users change roles, access modifications are tied to that identity
    - This means that less accounts are needed in the organisation
- Application management
    - Manage cloud and on-premises apps.
- Device management
    - Registration of devices
    - Management of devices
    - Access policies for devices, regardless of account

Active Directory can be connected with Azure Active Directory to enable consistent identities.
