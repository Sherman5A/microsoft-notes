Authentication,

> Proving that your are who you are.

Azure supports,
- Standard passwords
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Multifactor authentication
- Passwordless

## Single Sign-On

User signs in one time and uses that credential to access multiple resources and aplications.

The applications and resources used must trust the intial authenticator for SSO to work.

Remembering many passwords can increase the risk of security incidents, as users have trouble remembering
passwords.

Furthermore, this places more strain onto helpdesks as they must deal with password resets and lockouts.

Using SSO, simplifies the security model of a business.

## Multifactor Authentication

Adds extra layer of authentication. This protects against password compromises.

## Passwordless Authentication

More convenient than password-based authentication. However, it must be set up on a device before it
can work. Once a computer has been enrolled, you can use a pin or fingerprint to authenticate without
the need for a password.

Various passwordless authentication methods are available,
- Window hello
- Microsoft authenticator
- FIDO2 keys
