# Roll Based Access Control (RBAC)

Azure provides roles that describe access roles for cloud resources.

Custom roles can also be created.

When a user is assigned a role, they inherit the roles permissions.

Roles are applied to a scope. This can include resources, resources groups, subscriptions, or management
groups.
