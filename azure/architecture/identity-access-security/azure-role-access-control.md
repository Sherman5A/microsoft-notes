# Roll Based Access Control (RBAC)

![[role-based-access-scope.png]]

> Azure provides pre-defined and custom roles that describe access controls for cloud resources.

When a user is assigned a role, they inherit the permissions assigned to the role.

Roles are applied to a scope. 

Scopes  include:
- Resources
- Resources groups
- Subscriptions
- Management groups
