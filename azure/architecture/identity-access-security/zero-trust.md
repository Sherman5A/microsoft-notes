# Zero Trust Security Model

Zero trust

> Security model that asssumes the worst case scenario always happens.

It asssumes breach at the outset, verifying each request as though it originated from an unknown network.

Principles:
- Verify explicitly
    - Always authenticate and authorise based on all data points
- Use least privelaged access
    - Limits users with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access policies
        - Just-In-Time - **Access is given on limited amounts of time, or on an as-needed basis**
        - Just-Enough-Access - **Users are given a minimal amount of access, just enough to work**
