# External Identities

External identity:
> A device, person, or service outside the organisation.

Azure AD External Identities are the ways you can interact with external identities. These could be 3rd party businesses, guests, or customers.

You can specify how external identities get resources, and how internal users interact with them.

**Example:**

A developer can manage customer's identity experiences.

External identities can bring their own identities. This could be a issued identity or a Google account.
