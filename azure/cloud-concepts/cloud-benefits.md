# Cloud Benefits

1. High Availability
    - Important that resources are always available, high availability is desired.
    - Cloud providers are highly available and able to scale when required.
    - SLA *(Service level agreement)* states the up-time of a service available to a consumer. 
	    - It is shown using a percentage of up-time. However, higher levels of SLA are more expensive.

2. Scalability
    - Ability to adjust resources to meet demands
    - Means you don't overpay for services
    - 2 types of scalability:
        - Vertical Scaling - **More CPUs or RAM can be added to the virtual machine**
          - **Capability of the resource is increased.**
        - Horizontal Scaling - **Additional virtual machines are added**
          - **Greater amount of resources**

3. Reliability
    - Ability of system to recover from failures whilst continuing to function.
    - Since the cloud is decentralised, resources can be deployed in many regions, therefore if one
      region fails, other regions are still working and your applications still function.

## Predictability

4. Performance
    - Performance depends on predicting the required resources for your customer base.
    - Auto-scaling, load balancing, high availability allow for performance predicting.
    - If you suddenly need more resources, auto-scaling deploys additional resources.
    - If traffic is focused on an area, load balancing redirects traffic to less stressed area.

5. Cost
    - Predicting the cost of the cloud. Cloud allows for tracking and monitoring resources to estimate
      the costs of cloud spends.

## Governance

Governance Benefits:
- Set templates ensuring corporate and government standards are met.
- Templates can be updated as standards change.
- Auditing flags resources that are not compliant - Provides mitigation strategies
- Automatic software patches and updates.

## Security

Security Benefits:

>Varying control levels:
1. Infrastructure as a service
    - Provides max control of security.
    - Simply provides consumer with Physical resources. They manage the operating system and software.
2. Platform as a service
    - Manages software and operating system.
3. Software as a service
    - Manages software and operating system.

Cloud providers are well suited to handling DDoS attacks.

## Manageability

Two types of manageability:

> Management of the cloud

Managing the resources you have:
- Scaling resources
- Deploying resources
- Monitoring
- Automatic alerts

> Management in the cloud

What you use to manage the cloud and access it:
- Web portal
- CLI
- APIs
