# Consumption Based Model

Two models:

1. Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
    - One-time expense.
    - Examples: new building, buying a data-centre.

2. Operation Expenditure (OpEx)
    - Spending money over time.
    - Examples: leasing, cloud services, renting buildings.

> If you don't use IT resources, you don't pay for any IT resources.

Benefits:
- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase infrastructure.
- Can pay for more resources when required.
- Can stop paying for resources when not required.

This makes cloud computing far more adaptable than private hosting.
