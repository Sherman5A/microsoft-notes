# Tags

Resources are already placed into resource groups and subscriptions. However, we can also tag resources
to provide more information.

    - Tags enable you to locate resources with specific workloads, environments, business unit, and
      owners
- Cost management and optimisation
    - Tags group resources to make cost reports easier
- Operations management
    - Tags enable grouping resources based on the importance of their availability
    - Helps with SLAs
- Security
    - Classify data by security level
    - Tag resources with governance or regulatory compliance requirements
- Workload optimisation
    - Perform automated tasks based on tags

> Tags take the form of key value pairs
